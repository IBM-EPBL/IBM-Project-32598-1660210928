    <p>A news application is a big interactive database that tells a news story. Think of it like you would any other piece of journalism. It just uses software instead of words and pictures.</p>
    <p>By showing each reader data that is specific to them, a news app can help each reader understand a story in a way that’s personally meaningful to them. It can help a reader understand their personal connection to a broad national phenomenon, and help them attach what they know to what they don’t know, and thereby encourage a deep understanding of abstract concepts.</p>
    <p>We tend to build news apps when we have a dataset (or think we can acquire a dataset) that is national in scope yet granular enough to expose meaningful details.</p>
    <p>A news app should tell a story, and just like any good news story, it needs a headline, a byline, a lead, and a nut graph. Some of these concepts can be hard to distinguish in a piece of interactive software, but they’re there if you look closely.</p>
    <p>Also, a news app should be generative — meaning it should generate more stories and more reporting. ProPublica’s best apps have been used as the basis for local stories.</p>
    <p>For instance, take our Dollars for Docs news app. It tracked, for the first time, millions of dollars of payments by drug companies to doctors, for consulting, speaking, and so on. The news app we built lets readers look up their own doctor and see the payments they’ve received. Reporters at other news organizations also used the data. More than 125 local news organizations, including the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch did investigative stories on local doctors based on Dollars for Docs data.</p>
    <p>A few of these local stories were the result of formal partnerships, but the majority were done quite independently – in some cases, we didn’t have much if any knowledge that the story was being worked on until it came out. As a small but national news organization, this kind of thing is crucial for us. We can’t have local knowledge in 125 cities, but if our data can help reporters who have local knowledge tell stories with impact, we’re fulfilling our mission.</p>
    <h3>User Interface</h3>
    <p>It is an old saying “first impression is the last impression”. So the developer should make sure that the application should leave a mark on the users. This is where you need to focus on bringing interactive, visual and architectural designs as well. It means that the content should be distributed in the app such that the screen do not appear crowded with the content.</p>
    <h3>Filter content</h3><p>The option of filtering the content based on different category should be incorporated in the app to provide the audience wide taste and sensibilities. So the users can read news that matters to them.</p>
    <h3>Easy offline access</h3>
    <p>When a user is not online due to some reason he/she should have to access to the internet. Whenever the user is online the news content is downloaded in the cache memory of the app, this is how a user can access to the content offline.</p>
    <h3>Social Media integration</h3><p>This will help the users to share news on various platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This will not only give an amazing user experience and also will also increase the views.</p>
    <h3>Premium content</h3><p>If you wish, a separate section for the premium content can be added to the app that you can make available for your privileged customers.

        If these features are kept in mind then you will definitely have an amazing news app which will help the users get real time updates.</p>
